When I think of math puzzles in CICS, I remember the puzzles that my dad gave me during 
elementary school. My favorite puzzle from my dad is the 16 doors puzzle, where you can 
begin whenever you like, but you have to go though every door once (not twice!). My dad 
often challenged me with these types of puzzle, which fueled my love for games like sudoku
and get the red car out. Additionally, the math puzzles in class remind me of the TV show 
NUMBE3RS, where a genuis mathematician helps the CIA with crimes; I am always fascinated
with the way that they explain the math and computer programs. In most expisodes, the math 
is exaggerated, but can be fairly accurate overall.

Like I stated before, my favorite math puzzle is Sudoku, which is the only game on my  
phone. Sudoku is logic-based puzzle on 9x9 grid where the objective is to place the numbers 
1-9 once in each columon, row and smaller 3x3 block.
