When I think of math puzzles in CICS, I remember the puzzles that my dad gave me during 
elementary school. My favorite puzzle from my dad is the 16 doors puzzle, where you can 
begin whenever you like, but you have to go though every door once (not twice!). My dad 
often challenged me with these types of puzzle, which fueled my love for games like sudoku
and get the red car out.
